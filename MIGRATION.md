# ArgoCD Agent Migration Guide

## Overview
Migrating from traditional ArgoCD hub-and-spoke to agent-based architecture.

## Current State
- ArgoCD installed in `argocd` namespace
- Applications managed via direct cluster connections
- Repository: https://github.com/jfr992/argocd-playground-agents.git

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Install ArgoCD Agent Extension
The agent extension needs to be installed in the existing ArgoCD control plane.

### Step 2: Deploy Agent to Target Clusters
Install agents in clusters that will be managed by ArgoCD.

### Step 3: Register Clusters via Agent
Replace direct cluster connections with agent-based connections.

### Step 4: Migrate Applications
Update application destinations to use agent clusters.

### Step 5: Remove Direct Cluster Connections
Clean up traditional cluster secrets once migration is complete.
